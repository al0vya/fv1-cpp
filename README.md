# FV1_cpp

## About

This project is a model that can simulate one-dimensional shallow water flow by numerically solving the [shallow water equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_water_equations).

To use this model you need to have [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or higher. You also need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Building the model executable

Open the `FV1_cpp.sln` file in Visual Studio 2019 and from the toolbar at the top, click `Build > Rebuild All`.

## Running the model

Navigate to `FV1_cpp\FV1_cpp\FV1_cpp` using File Explorer. Click into the search bar of the explorer, type in `cmd` and press enter to open a command line. In the command line, type in `python test.py` and press enter to see further instructions on how to run the model.

## In-built test cases

The model supports 7 in-built tests. The outputs from each test are shown in the animations below. The animations can be used to check for correctness if the model is modified in any way.
